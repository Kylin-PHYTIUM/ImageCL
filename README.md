# ImageCL #

ImageCL is a simplified version of OpenCL, specifically aimed at image processing. A source-to-source translator can translate ImageCL multiple different OpenCL versions, with different optimizations applied. An auto-tuner can then be used to pick the best OpenCL for a given device.

ImageCL is described in the following academic paper:
