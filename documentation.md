# ImageCL Documentation #

## Compilation ##

ImageCL requires the ROSE library (http://rosecompiler.org/) to be installed. ImageCL does not have any other dependencies beyond those that ROSE itself has.

Once ROSE has been installed, update the relevant paths in the Makefile, and compile with make all.
